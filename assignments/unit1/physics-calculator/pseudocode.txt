Objectives: 
Create a menu that works through several physics calculations
Solve for velocity, acceleration, 4 motion equations, NSL, weight, and momentum 
Show the steps to solve (like showing your work)

Fake Wanna Be Pretend Code: 

Display a Main Menu
    What would you like to calculate?
        1. Velocity 
        2. Acceleration 
        3. Motion
        4. Force
        5. Weight
        6. Momentum

        0. EXIT
    
    User will input an integer from 0-6. Validate the input. 
    

Until the user hits exit (Do, While(not pressing exit)

Clear the Screen.

1. Velocity Menu
    Velocity
    Return to the main menu at any time by typing "Menu!" (Case sensitive)
    Velocity is the change in position divided by the change in time.
    What is the change in position?
    *User inputs a double. Validate. *
    What units? 
    *User inputs a string. Validate.*
    What is the change in time?
    *User inputs a double. Validate.*
    What units? 
    *User inputs a string. Validate*
    units = posUnits + " / " + timeUnits
    v=ds/dt (use the delta symbol if possible)
    v=*plug in for the users inputs*
    v= *the result after doing calculations* *units, but after calculations*

    When you are ready to return to the main menu, type 0.

2. Acceleration
    This uses the same exact logic as above, but with some different words.
    When displaying the units, do this:
        m/s*s or meters / second times second == (m/s)/s or m/s^2
        do this one: meters/(s*s) to be as accurate as possible. We shouldn't assume the user will use conventional units or best practices. 

//Just return a string that does the calculations for us
string physicsMultiplier(bunch of variables))

    //the bunch of variables
    string units1
    string units2 
    double value1
    double value2
    double result
    
    if multiply is true then 
        result = value 1 * value 2
        return "" + result + " " + units1 * units 2
    else   
        result = value 1 / value 2
        return "" + result + " " + units1 / units 2

    return "Error. No deets sorry you're your own" (jk provide some explanation if something goes wrong, but nothing should.)

Usage for the physicsMultiplaction function: 
    Go through the whole menu and then this just does the calculation for you


Menu Builder function
    this function will help us to build the menus for our stuff, since we're gonna have a lot of menus.
